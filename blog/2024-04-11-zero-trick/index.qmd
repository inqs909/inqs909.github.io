## Introduction

My dissertation at UC Riverside focused on modeling joint longitudinal-survival models from a frequentist approach. While there were some benefit estimating the parameters using the [EM Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm), there were several challenges that I wanted to overcome. And Bayesian approach had better capabilities at solving those problems.

Now that I am working on expanding my skills as a statistician, I can't help but wanting to estimate my model using a Bayesian approach. So I set off to read every paper that implemented the joint longitudinal-survival model in a Bayesian framework. And while I was reading other statisticians code to implement their models on github, I always encountered the 'Zero-Trick' to model the survival component.
