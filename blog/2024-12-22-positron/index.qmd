Positron and Python are both new to me, but as always, the first step is installing the software on your computer. In this post, I will highlight my adventures installing both of these softwares on to my computer. I will layout what is working and what is not working. 

**Disclaimer: I daily drive Linux, currently using Fedora, so my experiences will be different.**

## Positron

Since I had R installed, my first intuition was to install Positron becuase I learned that was the new ide, *still in beta*, from Posit that will allow users to work in both R and in Python. Therefore, I can learn how to use python without having to worried about choosing a proper IDE. 

To install Positron, go to their [website](https://positron.posit.co) and click on [get started](https://positron.posit.co/start.html). Afterwards, follow the instructions to prepare your computer to use positron. This involves either installing R from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) or Python via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) ([Windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)). Once that is done, you can navigate to their download [page](https://positron.posit.co/download.html), where you download the appropriate file^[Lucked out they had Fedora.]. Afterwards, run the installer and follow the prompts. And there you go, Positron should be ready for use.

After you install Positron, it should look like this:

Note that I changed the appearance of Positron to dark theme. Here is Positron when Python is being utilized:

### VS Code

Positron is based on Microsoft's [Code OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) platform, which makes it look very similar to [visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) similar to RStudio, but it is program agnostic. Additionally, it is capable to be more customizable with the use of extensions provided by [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/); however, you may install extensions from [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) as well.

## Python

As you are installing Positron, you should notice that there are instructions to installing python on to your system. If you have python already installed on your computer, Positron should allow you to point to it. However, Posit has recommended to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). After playing around with it, I also recommend it for now.

Why pyenv? First, it looks like Positron works better with pyenv installed. Therefore, I decided to stick with posit's recommendation and utilize it. Afterwards, I played around with it and installed the latest version of python and some modules/libraries/packages. It worked, and it seemed like it did not change anything in my systen for now. I think what I liked the most about it was the minimalist nature of the program. I feel a little more confident that it only install this piece of software and nothing more. 

### Virtual Environments and pyenv

I recently learned that the best way to use python is by creating virtual environments and installing everything you need for python in that environment. This is a completely new idea for me since R never required me to use it. I have heard of [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) designed to create a reproducible environment, but I never utilized. In hindsight, if I learned more about it, python may have been easier to start off.

## Data Science Projects


In Positron, and VS Code, projects are created as workspaces by associating folders as specialized place called workspaces. These workspaces allow you to organize your projects as necessary, such as creating folders for you scripts, data, source files, and much more. Additionally, you can initialize a git repository for the work space 

It is highly recommended to creat a workspace for any project you work on.

### Python

To create a Python-based workspace, you will go to the top right corner and click on the folder icon:

This will open a new drop-down menu:

![](img/Screenshot%20From%202024-12-26%2014-38-04.png)

Click on the "New Project..." to begin creating a workspace. This will then create a new window:

![](img/Screenshot%20From%202024-12-26%2014-38-21.png)

Now select the "Python Project" and click "Next". Afterwards, a new window will popup asking you to create a new folder and where to store it:

![](img/Screenshot%20From%202024-12-26%2014-38-57.png)

Notice that I have the "Initialize project at Git repository", if you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and plan to use it, it would be a good idea to initialize it. Then, a new window will popup asking you to create a new Python environment:

![](img/Screenshot%20From%202024-12-26%2014-39-29.png)

I recommend doing so. This will create a new environment that I believe will only be used for the project. Note, you will need to install the python modules again for this new environment. A final window will popup:

![](img/Screenshot%20From%202024-12-26%2014-39-50.png)

You should click "New Window" for now. This will open a new session of Positron. It may take a few minutes to create the python environment, but it will work after.
