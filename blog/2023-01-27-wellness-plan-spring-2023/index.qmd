## Areas of Improvement

Before I can design a wellness plan, I need to assess all areas of my life and see what I can work on improving. Below are a list areas that are important to me:

While there are many other aspects of my life that I would like to improve on, this is a good starting point in this semester.

## Goals

Looking at the areas that I want to focus on, I want to create goals that are realistic to achieve. Additionally each goal can satisfy multiple aspects of my life. I am going to use [SMART](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf) goals to make sure I create achievable goals. The time span for all the goals is the Spring semester.

## Goal 1

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Goal

I will spend at least 1 hour every day, Mondays through Friday, working on research related to my dissertation.
:::

I would like to increase my research productivity for my own career goals. Additionally, working on this will help me through my tenured process.

## Goal 2

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Goal

Each month, I will learn how to create a new tea-related beverage at home.
:::

This goal has a potential to serve 3 aspects of my life: Physical, Environmental, and Financial. Learning how to create new tea drinks will allow me to save money instead of going out to buying them form different coffee shops. Additionally, I will have knowledge on what ingredients are being used in the drinks. Therefore, I will be able to improve the physical aspect of my life. Lastly, this will help the environmental aspect of my life by reducing my environmental impact and use less plastic.

## Goal 3

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Goal

Each month, I will travel to a new city in Southern CA and buy their local newspaper.
:::

One of my main goal is to travel more globally and locally. I especially want to get to know small communities located in Southern California. For that reason, I want to make an effort to explore more of Southern CA. This goal has the potential to affect 4 aspects of my life: mental, social, spiritual and physical.

## Goal 4

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Goal

I will go swimming 2 times a week for 30 minutes.
:::

When I was planning to move to Camarillo, I wanted to start something new for my physical health. Therefore, I decided to start swimming.

## Goal 5

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Goal

I will go to the gym 3 times a week for 1 hour.
:::

Similar to swimming, I want to develop new habits and exercise more. Developing the habit and go to gym more will help my physical health.

## Plan

::: panel-tabset
## Goal 1

Since I am struggling to keep me research productivity up, I am going try new strategies. In order to get more research done, my plan is to work on research the very first thing I do when I get into my office. If I complete this task at the beginning of my day, I will get it out of the way and I will focus on things that are easier for me. The idea is, for the things I struggle to do, I will do them at the very beginning of my day.

Additionally, I plan to use the [Forest App](https://www.forestapp.cc/) to maintain my focus. I will do a 20 minute session of writing[^1] then do a 10 minute break. I will repeat this process until I complete an hour of writing.

## Goal 2

As of right now, I am working on learning how to make a chai latte at home. So far I have learned how to make oat milk the way I like it. The next thing I want to do is make chai concentrate using raw ingredients. I have bought many of the tools and feel ready to start experimenting making the concentrate.

Other types of teas that I want to learn are hibiscus and Thai.

## Goal 3

I first plan to visit Ojai in February. Depending on the weather, I want to visit Twentynine Palms for the [super bloom](https://sandiegoexplorer.com/california-wildflowers-california-superbloom/); otherwise, I will visit Carpinteria. Lastly, I want to visit Idyllwild. For each location, I want to visit a special event/festival if possible.

## Goal 4

## Goal 5

Similar to research goals, my plan is to go to the gym in the morning and get them done early so I can focus on other things I am interested in. I plan to go to the gym early in morning every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This task will be before my writing sessions.
:::

[^1]: writing means any task related to research

## Accountability

There are two ways that I will try told hold myself accountable. First, I will share my wellness plan with friends and family members. Second, I will try to create an incentive plan for each goal that I complete. Right before spring break (3/17/23), I will reassess my goals and adjust accordingly. Overall, I want to create consistency with these goals. Any positive gain will be a win.
