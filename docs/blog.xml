<section id="my-programming-journey" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-programming-journey">My Programming Journey</h2>
<p>I first learned about programming, when I did a Biostatistics internship where we analyzed data using SAS<sup>1</sup>. This was the first time where I sent commands to a computer to conduct a task, and I thoroughly enjoyed doing this. However, when my internship was over, I no longer had access to SAS at my own institution and could not learn more about Statistics or programming because of a huge financial barrier. This is where I learned about R and it being free and open-source software. This was a game changer! I was able to learn more about statistics and programming because the ultimate barrier was removed. Yes, it was completely different from SAS, but I can learn, and no one can stop me.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://csumb.edu/">CSUMB</a>, I went on to get my Master’s in Public Health<sup>2</sup> at <a href="https://publichealth.sdsu.edu/">San Diego State University</a> where I expanded my R skills and really got to learn how to use <a href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/">RStudio</a>. Afterwards, I started my PhD in Applied Statistics at <a href="https://statistics.ucr.edu/">UC Riverside</a> where I refined my programming skills even further. Additionally, I learned how to program in c++, well at least via Rcpp, to efficiently complete my dissertation. As you can see, my programming journey primarily focused on langauges that helped my Statistics journey, it being R.</p>
<p>As an Assistant Professor of Statistics at <a href="https:\www.csuci.edu">CSUCI</a> where we are planning to <a href="https://www.csuci.edu/news/releases/2024-new-bachelors-degree-data-science.htm">launch</a> a new BS in Data Science program this upcoming Fall 2025. As part of the program, we are planning to teach an Introduction to Data Science course with python, in addition to several other courses that will be taught in R or SQL. Therefore, there is a need for me to learn python and SQL to properly train my students.</p>
<p>As I am learning python, I am not really planning to switch to it. I will still use R for all my work. In honesty, I would rather get better at c++ via rcpp, learn <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a>, learn <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a>, or truthfully get better at <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> via <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>. However, I understand that python is a popular language for data scientist, and it would be a disservice to my students if I do not learn and properly train them.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-will-i-learn" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-will-i-learn">How will I learn?</h2>
<p>Every time I began to work with python, I always dreaded it. I think because I was coming from R as a Statistician, I was always so upset on how difficult it is to begin working in python. In R, getting started is super easy: install R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>, install RStudio form <a href="https://posit.co/">Posit</a>, and then install R packages and there we go!. In python, it is install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anacanda</a>, use jupyter or spyder, and try to do data analysis. And so I do it for a few days, then I need to run another program, most likely R, and learn that it will no longer run due to changes in R. I later learned that Anaconda changed my system, and I would have to delete it get back to my work. I do not know what is going on with Anaconda, but changing R in my system without telling me is unacceptable<sup>3</sup>. This leads me back to the R community for solutions.</p>
<section id="learning-python-the-r-way" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-python-the-r-way">Learning python, the R way!</h3>
<p>Reading a few blog posts online, many R users learning python recommended to just simply install python, install VS Code, and have VS code point to the python version you would like to work with. Afterwards install the python libraries<sup>4</sup>, the same way as you would install R packages. Fortunately, Posit is developing their next generation Data Science IDE, called <a href="https://positron.posit.co/">Positron</a>, designed for both R and python users. What I appreciate the most is that they have <a href="https://positron.posit.co/start.html">instructions</a> to install python via <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a>. As of right now, it has allowed me to learn python without changing my system. Additionally, I am able to learn positron, which is not bad at all. My only gripe is that I can not move the console to the top-right as I have it in my RStudio.</p>
</section>
<section id="intro-to-data-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intro-to-data-science">Intro to Data Science</h3>
<p>The main mechanism I am using to learn python is by converting <a href="https://datasciencebox.org/">Data Science in a Box</a> to a python-based course instead of an R-based course. There are several reasons to do it this way. First, I understand what is going on in the course and can read the R code, so I can translate to python and know when I am making a mistake. Second, I have not found python versions of this course<sup>5</sup>; therefore, it will force me to really learn python. Third, the course is very user-friendly for our students. The topics they provide are fascinating, and I believe it is more suitable to my students. Fourth, there license is very permissable, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> for the win! Fifth, other faculty members in my department have expressed interest in teaching a Data Science course with this material. Therefore, for all these reasons, and many more, I will be learning python, well the basics at least, by converting Data Science in a Box from R to python.</p>
<p>While I am translating/designing this course, there will be some deviations from the standard data science course. Most of decisions I will make is based on what is pedagogically more feasible for my students. For example, I will be using <a href="https://plotnine.org/">plotnine</a>, the <code>ggplot2</code> of python, to create graphics since the syntax is exactly the same as in R. Another one is using the <a href="https://pola.rs/">polars</a> library, an alternate version of <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, for data frames due to the simple nature data manipulation<sup>6</sup>. These design changes are meant to show students what is possible without scarying them away from the field. I do not know what other changes I will make, but I am positive there will be more.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I continue with building this Data Science Course, I will try to write blog posts writing my experiences, giving out tips, and possibly tutorials. I will also be writing about my experience with positron and a few other tools, possibly quarto<sup>7</sup>, and much more.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="areas-of-improvement">Areas of Improvement</h2>
<p>Before designing a wellness plan, I need to assess all areas of my life and see what I can improve. Below is a list of areas that are important to me:</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:40%;">
<ul>

<p>While there are many other aspects of my life that I would like to improve on, this is a good starting point for this semester.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Looking at the areas that I want to focus on, I want to create realistic goals. Additionally, each goal can satisfy multiple aspects of my life. I will use SMART goals to ensure <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf">SMART</a> goals to make sure I create achievable goals.

<p>Since I am struggling to keep my research productivity up, I will try new strategies. To get more research done, I plan to work on research as the very first thing I do when I get into my office. If I complete this task at the beginning of my day, I will get it out of the way and focus on things that are easier for me. The idea is to do the things I struggle with at the very beginning of my day.</p>
<p>Additionally, I plan to use the <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/">Forest App</a> to maintain my focus. I will do a 20 minute session of writing<sup>1</sup> and then do a 10 minute break. I will repeat this process until I complete an hour of writing.</p>

</div>
<div id="tabset-2-4" class="tab-pane" aria-labelledby="tabset-2-4-tab">

<p>Similar to my research goals, I plan to go to the gym in the morning and get them done early so I can focus on other things I am interested in. I plan to go to the gym early every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This task will be before my writing sessions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accountability">Accountability</h2>
<p>There are two ways that I will try told hold myself accountable. First, I will share my wellness plan with friends and family members. Second, I will create an incentive plan for each goal I complete. I will reassess my goals before spring break (3/17/23) and adjust accordingly. Overall, I want to create consistency with these goals. Any positive gain will be a win. At the end of the semester, I plan to reflect on the process and see what worked and what did not.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>At the beginning 2020, I learned that there were several undergraduate students interested in attending graduate school. However, many of them had the idea that they weren’t capable of succeeding in graduate school. This was nonsense! I TA’ed them through Regression and ANOVA courses and got to see first hand their capabilities. It was shocking to hear that they think like this. While I can go into details of my ideas why they think like this (possibly imposter syndrome<sup>1</sup>), this isn’t the post for it. I was set out to convince and prepare these students to apply to graduate school.</p>
<p>In the Spring Quarter of 2020, I decided to hold a virtual seminar in applying to graduate school<sup>2</sup>. The seminar focused on the application process and choosing the correct degree program. At the end of the seminar, approximately 15 undergraduate students attended, and we had a lively discussion between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty. It showed that undergraduate students were interested in pursuing graduate degrees. This motivated me to hold more events similar to this seminar.</p>
<p>In the Fall Quarter of 2020, I decided to hold a similar seminar for undergraduate students. However, I focused more on writing different statements as well as holding discussion at the end<sup>3</sup>. At the same time, my colleague sent me a tweet about a program from the University of Washington, the Statistics and Probability Association <a href="https://spa-drp.github.io/">Direct Reading Program</a>. It is an excellent program, and I decided to implement a similar program. Thus, the beginnings of the SMART Program was born!</p>
</section>
<section id="development" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="development">Development</h2>
<p>For the remainder of the Fall quarter, I began talking to other graduate students about creating a mentoring program within the department. I pitched them that they will mentor an undergraduate student for a statistical project. Many students seemed on board to participate in the program. Afterwards, I started asking Teaching Faculty to support the program. By the end of the quarter, I had an idea of the support I will get from the department.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, almost everyone had a rough winter due to the pandemic. Fatigued had set in to many students, and they needed time to rest. I myself struggled through the winter. It was challenging to rest during my break due to competing pressures. While I did manage to get through the winter, I did not want to add any extra pressure to the remaining graduate students that expressed interest in mentoring in the program. I decided to wait until half way through the quarter to begin asking graduate students for their commitment to the program. Fortunately, everyone was excited to be a mentor in the program.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was worried about having graduate students coming up with a project. I was afraid that students could not come up with an idea that was feasible for an undergraduate student to complete, so I decided to come up with a project that anyone can easily do. Thus the <a href="https://ucrgradstat.github.io/ucrstats/">ucrstats</a> package was born. The idea was for a mentor teach an undergrad about a topic, then the mentee can create a <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/">learnr</a> tutorial to teach other students. The only thing the mentor needed to do was gather materials and R code for the student to learn about the topic. The tutorials can easily be created using an RMarkdown file. At the end, the mentee will have a product that they can show off and put on their CV. It was a different type of project that focused on programming than the traditional form of research. Fortunately, all other graduate students had project ideas; however, this can be a good back up for those who do not have a project idea. Additionally, the package can be utilized from other graduate students in different departments who want to learn more about statistics.</p>
</section>
<section id="recruitment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recruitment">Recruitment</h2>
<p>We recruited undergraduate students for the program with an application using Google Forms. We asked for basic things such as what classes you took, write a couple of essays, and your interests in the projects.</p>
<p>Using all the information we gathered, we began the selection process. We ranked each student based on their interests, the classes they have completed, and how well they met the admission criteria. From their, we selected students based on their rankings.</p>
<p>Looking back at the application process, there are couple of things I wish we could have done a bit differently. First, I think we should ask for CVs or resumes. This way we can better learn about the student. Second, the application process should begin at least a month before the start of the quarter. We had to operate with some tight deadlines and I did not enjoy the pressure. Other than that I will need to consult with the current cohort for more recommendations.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>The SMART Pilot Program was launched in Spring 2021 with our first cohort of mentors and mentees. We held a small orientation with the mentees to set the expectations<sup>4</sup>. The remainder of the quarter went smoothly. There were a few bumps in the roads here and there, but most of it was providing guidance to the mentors. At the end of the quarter, we held a symposium where all groups presented their work.</p>
<p>Starting a program is tough! I worried about so many things. Mostly making sure both the mentors and mentees were progressing with their projects and gaining something the other time. However, I just needed to have faith that everything will go well. Fortunately, the pilot was a success! I was so impressed by everyone’s presentation, and I think we showed the department how capable both the graduate and undergraduate students are in completing a project. This was certainly a long process, but overall I am glad I started the program and excited to see where it goes from here.</p>
</section>
<section id="future" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future">Future</h2>
<p>As I am writing this post, I am moving on to my sixth year of my graduate program, and I have my eyes on graduating and moving on the next phase of my career. That being said, I don’t really know if I will be involved for the second year of the program. I hope I inspired other graduate students to take on the mantle and continue the program. I truly believe the program is a great asset for the department. If I am around for the second year of the program, I will most likely take a consulting position to ensure that other graduate students can continue the program without relying on me. Otherwise, I will prefer to only coordinate for the second year.</p>
<p>As for the program itself, I hope the program will serve students from marginalized communities. Particularly communities where Statistics has be utilized against them. We need better statisticians who constantly thinking about how their work can harm the most vulnerable. Those who will advocate for these groups and change the Statistics community for the better. My hope is that the program will train individuals who will advocate for a better future.</p>

<section id="journey" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="journey">Journey</h2>
<p>When I first started using Rcpp for my research, I had no idea what I was doing. All I knew was that you can incorporate C++<sup>1</sup> code in your R scripts to speed up data processing. I did spend some time learning C++ through <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/">www.learningcpp.com</a>, but I didn’t get far because my example program did not go well. Troubleshooting the problem was a nightmare. However, it did give me an idea of how C++ programming looks like.</p>
<p>Once, I decided to implement C++ for my research, I focused on how to incorporate it in R. At the time, I had a fairly strong R background, and I knew you can use C++ in R via Rcpp. Therefore, I spent some time learning more about Rcpp from their <a href="http://www.rcpp.org/">website</a> and book. After reading everything I could, I didn’t learn much. It was really advanced and not written for a newbie. However, I did learn that you can compile a C++ function<sup>2</sup> that can be executed in R via Rcpp. The challenge was to build a cpp file that contained functions for my analysis. I turned to <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html">Advanced R</a> by Hadley Wickham for more help.</p>
<p>Wickham’s book provided the necessary information to build basic functions to use in R. I learned how to write basic functions in cpp and making them executable with <code>cppFunction</code>. Additionally, the book covers the basic classes, looping, and function exporting. I felt prepared to write and use functions in R! However, my research required linear algebra, and it would have been a nightmare to program matrix multiplication with the basics. These challenges led me to <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a>.</p>
<p>RcppArmadillo is designed to incorporate the <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a> library in R via Rcpp. The Armadillo library contains functions that make it easy to conduct linear algebra in cpp. Additionally, it isn’t difficult to learn the syntax. The library is implemented to closely follow Matlab<sup>3</sup> syntax.</p>
<p>After writing functions and troubleshooting problems, I was able to export my functions to R. Making sure everything worked, I ran the same data on both my R and cpp functions, and it worked! I was able to produce the same value for each function. It gave me the confidence that I would be able to complete my research.</p>
<p>After successfully implementing cpp in my research, I wanted to know how much faster was my code. Going back to Wickham’s book, there was information on benchmarking different functions. Using the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/06/bench-1.0.1/">bench</a> package to identify how long each function was taking to execute, I found my R function took 13 times longer than my cpp function. I was shocked! I knew cpp would make my code faster, but I didn’t expect it to be that much faster<sup>4</sup>. This convinced me that all my efforts were worth it!</p>
</section>
<section id="using-rcpparmadillo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-rcpparmadillo">Using RcppArmadillo</h2>
<p>I like to keep my functions in separate scripts and source them from my main analysis script. Naturally, I have all my cpp function in a separate file. The first thing you will need to do is create a cpp file: <code>file_name.cpp</code>. The first lines in my files are given below<sup>5</sup>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb1-1">#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-2">#include &lt;Rcpp.h&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4">using namespace Rcpp;</span>
<span id="cb1-5">using namespace arma;</span>
<span id="cb1-6"></span>
<span id="cb1-7">// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first couple of lines indicates which header or standard files to be included for compilation. I like to think of them as the <code>library()</code> function in R. The next couple lines indicate the names for different libraries. Different libraries may have functions with the same. Namespace allows you to use functions with the same name but from different libraries. Similar with R’s <code>::</code> operator. The last line is used by the <code>sourcecpp()</code> function in R. It helps with library dependency.</p>
<p>Now we can create functions to be utilized in R. The code below calculates the mean in cpp:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb2-1">// [[Rcpp::export]]</span>
<span id="cb2-2"></span>
<span id="cb2-3">double mean_cpp(arma::vec x){</span>
<span id="cb2-4">  int n = x.size();</span>
<span id="cb2-5">  double x_sum = sum(x);</span>
<span id="cb2-6">  double x_mean = x_sum / n; </span>
<span id="cb2-7">  return x_mean; </span>
<span id="cb2-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first line tells R to make the following function accessible to the user<sup>6</sup>. The remaining lines are the function itself. Creating a function in cpp is similar to R<sup>7</sup>. The main difference is that you need to specify the data types. Combining the two chunks together, your cpp file should look similar to the chunk below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb3-1">#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;</span>
<span id="cb3-2">#include &lt;Rcpp.h&gt;</span>
<span id="cb3-3"></span>
<span id="cb3-4">using namespace Rcpp;</span>
<span id="cb3-5">using namespace arma;</span>
<span id="cb3-6"></span>
<span id="cb3-7">// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]</span>
<span id="cb3-8"></span>
<span id="cb3-9">// [[Rcpp::export]]</span>
<span id="cb3-10"></span>
<span id="cb3-11">double mean_cpp(arma::vec x){</span>
<span id="cb3-12">  int n = x.size();</span>
<span id="cb3-13">  double x_sum = sum(x);</span>
<span id="cb3-14">  double x_mean = x_sum / n; </span>
<span id="cb3-15">  return x_mean; </span>
<span id="cb3-16">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In R, you will need to load the following packages<sup>8</sup>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<span id="cb4-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">library</span>(RcppArmadillo)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The next step is to compile your cpp file. You can do this with the <code>sourceCpp()</code> function:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1">Rcpp<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"example_cpp.cpp"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will compile your functions and make them executable in R. You can now use your function like any other R function.</p>

<p>You can see that the cpp function is much faster than the R built-in function.</p>
</section>
<section id="speed-gains-explanation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="speed-gains-explanation">Speed Gains Explanation</h2>
<p>You may be asking why is R much slower than cpp. From what I can gather, R is an interpreted language while cpp is a compiled language. While I don’t really know what the difference is, it makes cpp much faster.</p>
<p>I like to think there is a difference of requirements. You need to be more careful with cpp because it does not convert inputs to the correct data type. R will do it automatically. Therefore, R takes more time to ensure everything is correct before computing a function. Cpp requires more thinking from the user, but will reward them with speed gains. I am sure there is way more to this simple explanation, but the end result is that cpp is much faster than R.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next Steps …</h2>
<p>As my research is progressing, I am noticing the need to incorporate different methods not found in the Armadillo library. For example, I want to incorporate the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a>. I learned there is an R package exists for the library, <a href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.gsl.html">RcppGSL</a>! This gives me hope that I can use it for my research. However, I want to use the Armadillo library alongside with GSL. This has a potential to bring new problems with data type incompatibilities. I have ideas for potential solutions, but I will need to test them out.</p>
<p>I also want to learn more about the capabilities of Rcpp. Specifically, what other functions does it contain. I learned that Rcpp has functions for distribution functions. This can be useful for expanding my research.</p>

<section id="journey" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="journey">Journey</h2>
<p>When I was implementing <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a>, there were a couple scenarios where I couldn’t find an easy function for a certain result. This is partly due to strictly sticking with the <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a> library for all my needs. I built functions to resolve these issues. However, I got to the point where I couldn’t rely on the armadillo library to compute the needed value. I needed to compute the value from the inverse cumulative distribution function (iCDF) of a standard normal distribution. The armadillo library is only for linear algebra and scientific computing. It did not have any distribution functions<sup>1</sup>. Therefore, I needed to find a solution to my problem.</p>
<p>Hadley Wickham’s <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/">book</a> describes how to use R functions in cpp code. However, I worried that this may computationally taxing by switching from one language to another. Therefore, I searched for potential solutions to compute the iCDF of a normal distribution. This has brought me to this incredible website: <a href="https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/">Rcpp for everyone</a>.</p>
<p>Rcpp for everyone is an excellent website that provides the complete basics of using cpp in R. It is comprehensive that can answer the majority<sup>2</sup> of your questions when implementing Rcpp. Highly recommend reading it before you implement Rcpp in your code.</p>
<p>To obtain the iCDF, I needed to use the <a href="https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/310_Rmath.html">R Math Library</a><sup>3</sup>. This library seems to be loaded when you included in the <code>Rcpp.h</code> file. However, you will need to include the line <code>using namespace R</code> or <code>R::</code> in your cpp code. Below is an example of making <code>qnorm</code> executable in R:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb1-1">double qnorm_cpp(double p, double mean, double sd, int lower, int log){</span>
<span id="cb1-2">  double val = R::qnorm(p, mean, sd, lower, log);</span>
<span id="cb1-3">  return val;</span>
<span id="cb1-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it can be used to obtain the iCDF of a standard normal distribution:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 0</code></pre>

<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

font-style: inherit;">0</span>, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>For my research, I didn’t need create an executable function for R. However, I did worry about compatibility issues with the Armadillo library. Fortunately, the function returns a double value making it easy to work with.</p>
<p>Once I learned about these different functions, I decided to clean my cpp code with a couple of other functions. For example, I needed to take the factorial of a number. The Armadillo library does not provide a useful function. Therefore, I wrote a function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb6-1">double fact (int x){</span>
<span id="cb6-2">  if (x == 0){</span>
<span id="cb6-3">    return 1;</span>
<span id="cb6-4">  } else if (x == 1){</span>
<span id="cb6-5">    return 1;</span>
<span id="cb6-6">  } else {</span>
<span id="cb6-7">    int ide = x - 1;</span>
<span id="cb6-8">    arma::vec ff = linspace(1, x, x);</span>
<span id="cb6-9">    arma::vec ccpp = cumprod(ff);</span>
<span id="cb6-10">    double post = ccpp[ide];</span>
<span id="cb6-11">    return post;</span>
<span id="cb6-12">  }</span>
<span id="cb6-13">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, it isn’t a pretty function. However the Rcpp provides the following function: <code>factorial</code><sup>4</sup>. Below is the implementation of the function to obtain a double value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb7-1">double fact_cpp(double x){</span>
<span id="cb7-2">  NumericVector y = NumericVector::create(x);</span>
<span id="cb7-3">  double val = Rcpp::factorial(y)[0];</span>
<span id="cb7-4">  return val;</span>
<span id="cb7-5">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Below is code to benchmark the 2 functions:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1">bench<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>This is the first post of my “Rcpp” collection detailing my journey with Rcpp. The “Rcpp” collection contains information about the struggles I faced while implementing Rcpp. Even though my first venture to Rcpp happened in the Summer of 2020, I realized I am learning new things every day. I thought it would be wised to write a blog of everything I have and will learn with Rcpp. I hope this collection will guide other students who have never used c++ before.</p>
<p>As I am developing my model for my PhD, a major limiting factor is that my model takes a really long time to compute the results I need. Due to the complexity of the model, I need to approximate different components using iterative algorithms. This in turn increases the computation time to obtain results. You can only imagine my frustration when I first coded my model in R and it took more than a week to obtain results!</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to focus on speeding up my code. I spent time reading Wickham’s <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html">Advanced R</a> Book to speed up my code. There I learned how about vectorizing code, utilizing built-in optimized functions, and common practices for speed gains. All this work has made me a better R programmer. Unfortunately, when I reran my model, the speed gains was not enough to call my efforts a success.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Bcpspr9LTSvss/giphy.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Due to the lack of improvements, and knowing I will need expand my model for larger data sets, I set on a quest to improve my model. I attacked this problem on two fronts: looking for mathematical methods to reduce my computation needs and implementing different computing techniques. While both components dramatically improved my computational time, implementing c++ via Rcpp was the biggest game changer for my model.</p>
<p>After I implemented everything I can from Wickham’s <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html">Book</a>. I began reading more about about c++ from the book’s <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html">c++ chapter</a>. I will be honest, I didn’t know what I was doing. This was my first time learning how to use c++. Nevertheless, I was determined to learn more about the c++ due to the potential speed gains. During the summer of 2020, I spent all my time learning about c++ and Rcpp. By the end of my summer, a model that took 3.5 days to converge was now taking approximately 6 hours!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0GqssRweIhlz209i/giphy.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>With this triumph, I have been able to test and diagnose any faults with my model. I can honestly say that implementing Rcpp has drastically improved my PhD experience. I no longer have the feeling of being anxious for days wondering if my model works or not. I feel more productive! With this confidence, I feel prepared to tackle new problems with my research.</p>

<p>Welcome! I’ve decided to create this blog as a way to record my journey in Statistics. As I am working through my PhD, I’ve read numerous posts on vast topics. As I was reading about topics related to Rcpp. I noticed how difficult it was to implement Rcpp for my needs. At the same moment, it dawned on me that I am reading from individuals that at some point in time were struggling with the same issues. This inspired me to create a blog of my own with the same intentions to help other individuals. My hope is to demonstrate how I overcame the challenges I faced to others that are facing similar issues.</p>
<p>I don’t know how this blog will go. It’s going to be a learning experience. I don’t even know how many blog posts I will write in a year. I don’t even know what topics I will write about. However, I hope overtime, I can create a blog that may help people.</p>
