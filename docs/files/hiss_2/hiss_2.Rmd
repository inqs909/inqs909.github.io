# Introduction

## Introduction

- Building a personal website is a good way to display your accomplishments

- Using both RMarkdown and GitHub, you can create your own personal website from static web pages

- RMarkdown allows you to create static websites with very little programming

## Examples

```{r, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.inqs.info/")
```

## Examples

```{r, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_url("https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/")
```


# Git & GitHub

## Git

- Git is a version control software that track your changes in your code.

- It is similar to "see changes" to Google Docs, but for code

- We will use to deploy your website to Github

- Terminology

    - add: add file to list that needs to be saved

    - commit: save list of files
    
    - clone: copy a repository (folder)
    
    - push: upload changes to Github (or other websites)
    
    - pull: download changes from Github

## Git Installation

[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

- Windows

    - Download and install aplication

- Mac

    - Download and install aplication

    - Commandline
    
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git --version
```

- Linux

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sudo apt/dnf install git
```

## GitHub

- GitHub can be thought as the Google Drive for code

- GitHub allows you to host a static personal website with html and markdown files

- Contains version control


## GitHub Pages 

- GitHub pages allow you host a static website

- Set up is easy

- Additionally, GitHub will host a pre-built website from a repository

  - The website must be located in the `docs` folder

- Must create repo as USERNAME.github.io
  

# RStudio

## RStudio

- RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that organizes your R environment

- It contains 4 panes that organizes your editors, consoles, environment, plots and more

- It allows execution of your R code for data exploration

- It is free to download and install on any computer

- Visit their website for more information: [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## RStudio

- RStudio is integrated with git to quickly push updates to GitHub

- RStudio can build websites eliminating the need to render from other services

# RMarkdown

## RMarkdown

- RMarkdown is a special file format that allows you to create documents

- RMarkdown can be rendered into numerous different file formats:

    - Documents
        - HTML
        - PDF
    - Slides
        - slidy
        - ioslides
        - xaringan
    - Applications
        - Shiny
    - Books
    - Websites
    
- Given all its capabilities, I believe RMarkdown(Markdown) is the future!
        
    

# _site.yml

## _site.yml

- This file controls the contents in your website.

- It is based on a YAML file

    - Contains url information
    
    - Controls your menu options
    
    - Controls customizations
    
    - Controls output

# index.Rmd

## index.Rmd

- The index.Rmd file contains the information for your homepage

- Add a basic introduction about you

# Other Webpages

## Other Webpages

- To include other web pages, create an Rmd file and select `html_document` as its output

  - Add any other relevant information to the yaml header as needed
  
- Write text to the document as you would with any other Rmd file

## Navbar

- Any webpages you created need to be easily accessed from your website

- The navbar is the best place to access

- Add your webpages in the navbar section of your _site.yml file 

## Education.Rmd

- Add information about your education.

- Include any summer educational programs you participated in

## Links.Rmd

- Add links to other profiles about you
  
  - LinkedIn
  
  - Handshake
  
  - Portfolium
  
  - Resume/CV
  
  - Researchgate
  
  - Academia.edu
  
  - Other Websites
  
## Github

- You may be interested in displaying your GitHub profile separately from your Links.Rmd file

- You can place a link in the navbar and use the GitHub logo as the button

- Add the following code to the navbar section of the _site.yml file

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
    - icon: fab fa-github fa-lg
      href: https://github.com/USERNAME
```

# Customizations

## Changing themes

- default

- cerulean

- journal

- flatly

- readable

- spacelab

- united

- cosmo

- lumen

- paper

- sandstone

- simplex

- yeti


## Changing themes

Add the following lines to your _site.yml file

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
output:
  html_document:
    theme: cerulean
```

## Customizing Appearances

- Use a css file to further customize your website

  - Change appearance
  
  - Add components to your website

  - Best way is to change a variable and see what changes
  
  - Include in _site.yml to incorporate css file
  
  
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
output:
  html_document:
    css: styles.css
```
  

## Custom Domain Name

- Using Github, your domain name is set as USERNAME.github.io

- However, you can register a domain for a yearly price

- Prices are dependent on domain ending (.com, .org, ...)

# Updating Website

## Updating Website

- Update a website by changing the Rmd files as needed

- Add new web pages by creating new Rmd files

- Alter the look of the website by changing the css or _site.yml file

## Updating Website

Once you made all the changes, build the website as before
