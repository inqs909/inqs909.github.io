  abstract = {In the field of cardio-thoracic surgery, valve function is monitored over time after surgery. The motivation for our research comes from a study which includes patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. These patients are followed prospectively over time by standardized echocardiographic assessment of valve function. Loss of follow-up could be caused by valve intervention or the death of the patient. One of the main characteristics of the human valve is that its durability is limited. Therefore, it is of interest to obtain a prognostic model in order for the physicians to scan trends in valve function over time and plan their next intervention, accounting for the characteristics of the data. Several authors have focused on deriving predictions under the standard joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data framework that assumes a constant effect for the coefficient that links the longitudinal and survival outcomes. However, in our case, this may be a restrictive assumption. Since the valve degenerates, the association between the biomarker with survival may change over time. To improve dynamic predictions, we propose a Bayesian joint model that allows a time-varying coefficient to link the longitudinal and the survival processes, using P-splines. We evaluate the performance of the model in terms of discrimination and calibration, while accounting for censoring.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to model the progression of CD4-lymphocyte count and the relationship between different features of this progression and survival time. The complicating factors in this analysis are that the CD4-lymphocyte count is observed only at certain fixed times and with a high degree of measurement error, and that the length of the vector of observations is determined, in part, by the length of survival. If probability of death depends on the true, unobserved CD4-lymphocyte count, then the survival process must be modelled. Wu and Carroll (1988, Biometrics 44, 175-188) proposed a random effects model for two-sample longitudinal data in the presence of informative censoring, in which the individual effects included only slopes and intercepts. We propose methods for fitting a broad class of models of this type, in which both the repeated CD4-lymphocyte counts and the survival time are modelled using random effects. These methods permit us to estimate parameters describing the progression of CD4-lymphocyte count as well as the effect of differences in the CD4 trajectory on survival. We apply these methods to results of AIDS clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Multiple categorical variables are commonly used in medical and epidemiological research to measure specific aspects of human health and functioning. To analyze such data, models have been developed considering these categorical variables as imperfect indicators of an individual's "true" status of health or functioning. In this article, the latent class regression model is used to model the relationship between covariates, a latent class variable (the unobserved status of health or functioning), and the observed indicators (e.g., variables from a questionnaire). The Cox model is extended to encompass a latent class variable as predictor of time-to-event, while using information about latent class membership available from multiple categorical indicators. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, and standard errors are calculated based on the profile likelihood, treating the nonparametric baseline hazard as a nuisance parameter. A sampling-based method for model checking is proposed. It allows for graphical investigation of the assumption of proportional hazards across latent classes. It may also be used for checking other model assumptions, such as no additional effect of the observed indicators given latent class. The usefulness of the model framework and the proposed techniques are illustrated in an analysis of data from the Women's Health and Aging Study concerning the effect of severe mobility disability on time-to-death for elderly women.},

Instead of the usual normality assumption for measurement errors in the linear mixed effects sub-model, we adopt a t -distribution which has a longer tail and thus is more robust to outliers. We derive an EM algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters and estimate their standard errors using a profile likelihood method.

In this paper we study several shared random effects models in the multi-level repeated measures data setting with dependent failure times. Distinct random effects are used to characterize heterogeneity in repeated measures at different levels. The hazard of death may be dependent on random effects from various levels. To simplify the estimation procedure, we adopt the Gaussian quadrature technique with a piecewise log-linear baseline hazard for the death process, which can be conveniently implemented in the freely available software aML. As an example, we analyze repeated measures of hematocrit level and survival for end stage renal disease patients clustered within a randomly selected 126 dialysis centers in the U.S. renal data system data set.

This type of research question has given rise to a rapidly developing field of biostatistics research that deals with the joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data. In this article, we consider this modeling framework and focus particularly on the assessment of the predictive ability of the longitudinal marker for the time-to-event outcome. In particular, we start by presenting how survival probabilities can be estimated for future subjects based on their available longitudinal measurements and a fitted joint model. Following we derive accuracy measures under the joint modeling framework and assess how well the marker is capable of discriminating between subjects who experience the event within a medically meaningful time frame from subjects who do not. We illustrate our proposals on a real data set on human immunodeficiency virus infected patients for which we are interested in predicting the time-to-death using their longitudinal CD4 cell count measurements.},

This article is motivated by a study on patients with a renal allograft, in which interest lies in the association between longitudinal proteinuria (a dichotomous variable) measurements and the time to renal graft failure.

The identification of such a marker may be useful in assessing the efficacy of new therapies in a shorter period. The number of CD4-lymphocyte counts has been proposed as such a potential marker for human immune virus (HIV) trials because of its observed correlation with clinical outcome. But to evaluate the role of CD4 counts as a potential surrogate marker, we must better understand the relationship of clinical outcome to an individual's CD4 count history over time. The Cox proportional hazards regression model is used to study the relationship between CD4 counts as a time-dependent covariate and survival. Because the CD4 counts are measured only periodically and with substantial measurement error and biological variation, standard methods for estimating the parameters in the Cox model by maximizing the partial likelihood are no longer appropriate. Instead, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage the longitudinal CD4 count data are modeled using a repeated measures random components model. In the second stage methods for estimating the parameters in a Cox model when the data are assumed to be of this form are derived. We also considered methods to account for missing data patterns. These methods are applied to CD4 data from a randomized clinical trial of AIDS patients where half of the patients were randomized to receive Zidovudine (ZDV) and the other half were randomized to receive a placebo. Although a strong correlation between CD4 counts and survival is demonstrated, we also show that CD4 counts may not serve as a useful surrogate marker for assessing treatments for this population of patients.},

Estimates of the parameters are obtained by maximizing the joint likelihood for the covariate process and the failure time process. This approach uses the available information optimally because we use both the covariate and survival data simultaneously. Parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We argue that such a method is superior to naive methods where one maximizes the partial likelihood of the Cox model using the observed covariate values.

Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients.},
