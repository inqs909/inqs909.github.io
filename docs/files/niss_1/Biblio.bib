  abstract = {Nowadays there is an increased medical interest in personalized medicine and tailoring decision making to the needs of individual patients. Within this context our developments are motivated from a Dutch study at the Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Department of the Erasmus Medical Center, consisting of patients who received a human tissue valve in aortic position and who were thereafter monitored echocardiographically. Our aim is to utilize the available follow-up measurements of the current patients to produce dynamically updated predictions of both survival and freedom from re-intervention for future patients. In this paper, we propose to jointly model multiple longitudinal measurements combined with competing risk survival outcomes and derive the dynamically updated cumulative incidence functions. Moreover, we investigate whether different features of the longitudinal processes would change significantly the prediction for the events of interest by considering different types of association structures, such as time-dependent trajectory slopes and time-dependent cumulative effects. Our final contribution focuses on optimizing the quality of the derived predictions. In particular, instead of choosing one final model over a list of candidate models which ignores model uncertainty, we propose to suitably combine predictions from all considered models using Bayesian model averaging.},

  abstract = {In the field of cardio-thoracic surgery, valve function is monitored over time after surgery. The motivation for our research comes from a study which includes patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. These patients are followed prospectively over time by standardized echocardiographic assessment of valve function. Loss of follow-up could be caused by valve intervention or the death of the patient. One of the main characteristics of the human valve is that its durability is limited. Therefore, it is of interest to obtain a prognostic model in order for the physicians to scan trends in valve function over time and plan their next intervention, accounting for the characteristics of the data. Several authors have focused on deriving predictions under the standard joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data framework that assumes a constant effect for the coefficient that links the longitudinal and survival outcomes. However, in our case, this may be a restrictive assumption. Since the valve degenerates, the association between the biomarker with survival may change over time. To improve dynamic predictions, we propose a Bayesian joint model that allows a time-varying coefficient to link the longitudinal and the survival processes, using P-splines. We evaluate the performance of the model in terms of discrimination and calibration, while accounting for censoring.},

The goal of this paper is to demonstrate flexible and appropriate statistical methodology to assess the predictive capability of serial echocardiographic measurements of allograft aortic valve function. Moreover, the concept of joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data to optimally utilize the relationship between repeated valve function measurements and time-to-death or time-to-reoperation, is introduced and illustrated.

  abstract = {AbstractAortic gradient and aortic regurgitation are echocardiographic markers of aortic valve function. Both are biomarkers repeatedly measured in patients with valve abnormalities, and thus, it is expected that they are biologically interrelated. Loss of follow-up could be caused by multiple reasons, including valve progression related, such as an intervention or even the death of the patient. In that case, it would be of interest and appropriate to analyze these outcomes jointly. Joint models have recently received much attention because they cover a wide range of clinical applications and have promising results. We propose a joint model consisting of two longitudinal outcomes, one continuous (aortic gradient) and one ordinal (aortic regurgitation), and two time-to-events (death and reoperation). Moreover, we allow for more flexibility for the average evolution and the subject-specific profiles of the continuous repeated outcome by using B-splines. A disadvantage, however, is that when adopting a non-linear structure for the model, we may have difficulties when interpreting the results. To overcome this problem, we propose a graphical approach. In this paper, we apply the proposed joint models under the Bayesian framework, using a data set including serial echocardiographic measurements of aortic gradient and aortic regurgitation and measurements of the occurrence of death and reoperation in patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. The interpretation of the results will be discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to model the progression of CD4-lymphocyte count and the relationship between different features of this progression and survival time. The complicating factors in this analysis are that the CD4-lymphocyte count is observed only at certain fixed times and with a high degree of measurement error, and that the length of the vector of observations is determined, in part, by the length of survival. If probability of death depends on the true, unobserved CD4-lymphocyte count, then the survival process must be modelled. Wu and Carroll (1988, Biometrics 44, 175-188) proposed a random effects model for two-sample longitudinal data in the presence of informative censoring, in which the individual effects included only slopes and intercepts. We propose methods for fitting a broad class of models of this type, in which both the repeated CD4-lymphocyte counts and the survival time are modelled using random effects. These methods permit us to estimate parameters describing the progression of CD4-lymphocyte count as well as the effect of differences in the CD4 trajectory on survival. We apply these methods to results of AIDS clinical trials.},

  abstract = {In survival analyses that include a time-dependent covariate, the standard partial likelihood approach is often complicated by the fact that the necessary observations of the time-dependent covariate are not always available for the subjects in each risk set. In this article, we consider the situation of a binary time-dependent covariate. We specify a longitudinal model for the binary covariate with missing observations and a proportional hazards model for survival time conditional on fixed covariates and the completed time-dependent covariate history. The joint posterior distribution of the missing covariates and the parameters in the covariate and hazard models is simulated using Gibbs sampling. The joint modeling approach allows the missing covariates to be generated using all of the observed covariates as well as the disease outcome and failure time information. Simulation studies show that this approach often leads to lower bias of relative risk estimates associated with the time-dependent covariate and superior coverage of interval estimates as compared to variations of approaches based on imputing missing covariate values using previous values and then performing partial likelihood analysis. Our research is motivated by a study of survival of lung cancer patients after surgery in which current smoking status is a binary time-dependent covariate. We apply the methods to data from this study and explore the advantages of the joint modeling approach. The application demonstrates that the joint modeling approach can have improved efficiency in estimating the coefficients of both the fixed and the time-dependent covariates. Moreover, it can facilitate analyses using more complicated functions of the time-dependent covariate, such as cumulative smoking, that are difficult or inappropriate to use with the comparison methods.},

Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of {$<$} or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day.

At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03).

One example is the use of surrogate markers to predict disease onset or survival. Another is longitudinal trials which have outcome-related dropout. We describe a mixture model for the joint distribution which accommodates incomplete repeated measures and right-censored event times, and provide methods for full maximum likelihood estimation. The methods are illustrated through analysis of data from a clinical trial for a new schizophrenia therapy; in the trial, dropout time is closely related to outcome, and the dropout process differs between treatments. The parameter estimates from the model are used to make a treatment comparison after adjusting for the effects of dropout. An added benefit of the analysis is that it permits using the repeated measures to increase efficiency of estimates of the event time distribution. \textcopyright{} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To analyze such data, models have been developed considering these categorical variables as imperfect indicators of an individual's "true" status of health or functioning. In this article, the latent class regression model is used to model the relationship between covariates, a latent class variable (the unobserved status of health or functioning), and the observed indicators (e.g., variables from a questionnaire). The Cox model is extended to encompass a latent class variable as predictor of time-to-event, while using information about latent class membership available from multiple categorical indicators. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, and standard errors are calculated based on the profile likelihood, treating the nonparametric baseline hazard as a nuisance parameter. A sampling-based method for model checking is proposed. It allows for graphical investigation of the assumption of proportional hazards across latent classes. It may also be used for checking other model assumptions, such as no additional effect of the observed indicators given latent class. The usefulness of the model framework and the proposed techniques are illustrated in an analysis of data from the Women's Health and Aging Study concerning the effect of severe mobility disability on time-to-death for elderly women.},

We propose a joint model for longitudinal ordinal measurements and competing risks failure time data, in which a partial proportional odds model for the longitudinal ordinal outcome is linked to the event times by latent random variables. At the survival endpoint, our model adopts the competing risks framework to model multiple failure types at the same time. The partial proportional odds model, as an extension of the popular proportional odds model for ordinal outcomes, is more flexible and at the same time provides a tool to test the proportional odds assumption. We use a likelihood approach and derive an EM algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. We further show that all the parameters at the survival endpoint are identifiable from the data. Our joint model enables one to make inference for both the longitudinal ordinal outcome and the failure times simultaneously.

  abstract = {Existing methods for joint modeling of longitudinal measurements and survival data can be highly influenced by outliers in the longitudinal outcome. We propose a joint model for analysis of longitudinal measurements and competing risks failure time data which is robust in the presence of outlying longitudinal observations during follow-up. Our model consists of a linear mixed effects sub-model for the longitudinal outcome and a proportional cause-specific hazards frailty sub-model for the competing risks data, linked together by latent random effects. Instead of the usual normality assumption for measurement errors in the linear mixed effects sub-model, we adopt a t -distribution which has a longer tail and thus is more robust to outliers. We derive an EM algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters and estimate their standard errors using a profile likelihood method. The proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and is applied to a scleroderma lung study (\textcopyright{} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

In this paper we study several shared random effects models in the multi-level repeated measures data setting with dependent failure times. Distinct random effects are used to characterize heterogeneity in repeated measures at different levels. The hazard of death may be dependent on random effects from various levels. To simplify the estimation procedure, we adopt the Gaussian quadrature technique with a piecewise log-linear baseline hazard for the death process, which can be conveniently implemented in the freely available software aML. As an example, we analyze repeated measures of hematocrit level and survival for end stage renal disease patients clustered within a randomly selected 126 dialysis centers in the U.S. renal data system data set. Our model is very comprehensive yet easy to implement, making it appealing to general statistical practitioners. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Joint models for longitudinal and survival data have gained a lot of attention in recent years, with the development of myriad extensions to the basic model, including those which allow for multivariate longitudinal data, competing risks and recurrent events. Several software packages are now also available for their implementation. Although mathematically straightforward, the inclusion of multiple longitudinal outcomes in the joint model remains computationally difficult due to the large number of random effects required, which hampers the practical application of this extension. We present a novel approach that enables the fitting of such models with more realistic computational times. The idea behind the approach is to split the estimation of the joint model in two steps: estimating a multivariate mixed model for the longitudinal outcomes and then using the output from this model to fit the survival submodel. So-called two-stage approaches have previously been proposed and shown to be biased. Our approach differs from the standard version, in that we additionally propose the application of a correction factor, adjusting the estimates obtained such that they more closely resemble those we would expect to find with the multivariate joint model. This correction is based on importance sampling ideas. Simulation studies show that this corrected two-stage approach works satisfactorily, eliminating the bias while maintaining substantial improvement in computational time, even in more difficult settings.},

  abstract = {Joint models initially dedicated to a single longitudinal marker and a single time-to-event need to be extended to account for the rich longitudinal data of cohort studies. Multiple causes of clinical progression are indeed usually observed, and multiple longitudinal markers are collected when the true latent trait of interest is hard to capture (e.g., quality of life, functional dependency, and cognitive level). These multivariate and longitudinal data also usually have nonstandard distributions (discrete, asymmetric, bounded, etc.). We propose a joint model based on a latent process and latent classes to analyze simultaneously such multiple longitudinal markers of different natures, and multiple causes of progression. A latent process model describes the latent trait of interest and links it to the observed longitudinal outcomes using flexible measurement models adapted to different types of data, and a latent class structure links the longitudinal and cause-specific survival models. The joint model is estimated in the maximum likelihood framework. A score test is developed to evaluate the assumption of conditional independence of the longitudinal markers and each cause of progression given the latent classes. In addition, individual dynamic cumulative incidences of each cause of progression based on the repeated marker data are derived. The methodology is validated in a simulation study and applied on real data about cognitive aging obtained from a large population-based study. The aim is to predict the risk of dementia by accounting for the competing death according to the profiles of semantic memory measured by two asymmetric psychometric tests.

This type of research question has given rise to a rapidly developing field of biostatistics research that deals with the joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data. In this article, we consider this modeling framework and focus particularly on the assessment of the predictive ability of the longitudinal marker for the time-to-event outcome. In particular, we start by presenting how survival probabilities can be estimated for future subjects based on their available longitudinal measurements and a fitted joint model. Following we derive accuracy measures under the joint modeling framework and assess how well the marker is capable of discriminating between subjects who experience the event within a medically meaningful time frame from subjects who do not. We illustrate our proposals on a real data set on human immunodeficiency virus infected patients for which we are interested in predicting the time-to-death using their longitudinal CD4 cell count measurements.},

Even though these models enjoy a wide range of applications in many different statistical fields, they have not yet found their rightful place in the toolbox of modern applied statisticians mainly due to the fact that they are rather computationally intensive to fit. The main difficulty arises from the requirement for numerical integration with respect to the random effects. This integration is typically performed using Gaussian quadrature rules whose computational complexity increases exponentially with the dimension of the random-effects vector. A solution to overcome this problem is proposed using a pseudo-adaptive Gauss\textendash Hermite quadrature rule. The idea behind this rule is to use information for the shape of the integrand by separately fitting a mixed model for the longitudinal outcome. Simulation studies show that the pseudo-adaptive rule performs excellently in practice, and is considerably faster than the standard Gauss\textendash Hermite rule.},

In this article we propose a two-part shared parameter model framework that effectively takes this feature into account, and we investigate sensitivity to the various dependence structures used to describe the association between the longitudinal measurements of proteinuria and the time to renal graft failure. /// Beaucoup d'\'etudes longitudinales aboutissent \`a la fois \`a un d\'elai jusqu'\`a un \'ev\'enement d'int\'er\^et et \`a des donn\'ees en mesures r\'ep\'et\'ees.

The second model is for longitudinal data, which are assumed to follow a random effects model. Based on the trajectory of a subject's longitudinal data, some covariates in the survival model are functions of the unobserved random effects. Estimated random effects are generally different from the unobserved random effects and hence this leads to covariate measurement error. To deal with covariate measurement error, we propose a local corrected score estimator and a local conditional score estimator. Both approaches are semiparametric methods in the sense that there is no distributional assumption needed for the underlying true covariates. The estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. However, simulation studies indicate that the conditional score estimator outperforms the corrected score estimator for finite samples, especially in the case of relatively large measurement error.

The longitudinal data are assumed to follow a mixed effects model, and a proportional hazards model depending on the longitudinal random effects and other covariates is assumed for the survival endpoint. Interest may focus on inference on the longitudinal data process, which is informatively censored, or on the hazard relationship. Several methods for fitting such models have been proposed, most requiring a parametric distributional assumption (normality) on the random effects. A natural concern is sensitivity to violation of this assumption; moreover, a restrictive distributional assumption may obscure key features in the data. We investigate these issues through our proposal of a likelihood-based approach that requires only the assumption that the random effects have a smooth density. Implementation via the EM algorithm is described, and performance and the benefits for uncovering noteworthy features are illustrated by application to data from an HIV clinical trial and by simulation.},

The analysis of such studies poses challenges for modeling the impact of complex time-dependent drug exposure, especially given the uncertainty about the way effects cumulate over time and about the etiological relevance of doses taken in different time periods. We present a flexible method for modeling cumulative effects of time-varying exposures, weighted by recency, represented by time-dependent covariates in the Cox proportional hazards model. The function that assigns weights to doses taken in the past is estimated using cubic regression splines. We validated the method in simulations and applied it to re-assess the association between exposure to a psychotropic drug and fall-related injuries in the elderly.

Considerable recent interest has focused on so-called joint models, where models for the event time distribution and longitudinal data are taken to depend on a common set of latent random effects. In the literature, precise statement of the underlying assumptions typically made for these models has been rare. We review the rationale for and development of joint models, offer insight into the structure of the likelihood for model parameters that clarifies the nature of common assumptions, and describe and contrast some of our recent proposals for implementation and inference.},

  abstract = {A question that has received a great deal of attention in evaluating new treatments in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical trials is that of finding a good surrogate marker for clinical progression. The identification of such a marker may be useful in assessing the efficacy of new therapies in a shorter period. The number of CD4-lymphocyte counts has been proposed as such a potential marker for human immune virus (HIV) trials because of its observed correlation with clinical outcome. But to evaluate the role of CD4 counts as a potential surrogate marker, we must better understand the relationship of clinical outcome to an individual's CD4 count history over time. The Cox proportional hazards regression model is used to study the relationship between CD4 counts as a time-dependent covariate and survival. Because the CD4 counts are measured only periodically and with substantial measurement error and biological variation, standard methods for estimating the parameters in the Cox model by maximizing the partial likelihood are no longer appropriate. Instead, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage the longitudinal CD4 count data are modeled using a repeated measures random components model. In the second stage methods for estimating the parameters in a Cox model when the data are assumed to be of this form are derived. We also considered methods to account for missing data patterns. These methods are applied to CD4 data from a randomized clinical trial of AIDS patients where half of the patients were randomized to receive Zidovudine (ZDV) and the other half were randomized to receive a placebo. Although a strong correlation between CD4 counts and survival is demonstrated, we also show that CD4 counts may not serve as a useful surrogate marker for assessing treatments for this population of patients.},

  abstract = {In epidemiologic studies, analysis of the relationship between exposure intensity and risk is complicated by the fact that exposures often take place over extended periods, during which intensities can vary substantially. To relate exposure to outcome, it is necessary to combine information about duration, intensity and timing into a summary measure of exposure. If the aim of the exposure\textendash response analysis is to estimate the risk associated with differing exposure intensities, the results depend on the manner in which one incorporates intensity into the summary exposure metric. Most metrics used to summarize exposure, such as the cumulative exposure index, are time-weighted summations of intensity. They are thus based on the assumption that for any fixed time point, the effect of a unit of exposure is proportional to its intensity. This paper describes an approach for constructing and fitting summary measures of exposure that one can use to incorporate alternative assumptions about the effect of exposure intensity, as well as effects relating to the timing of exposure. Data from a study of lung cancer mortality in asbestos miners and millers serve to illustrate the method. Exposure metrics based on various functions of intensity and time of exposure are constructed and fitted to the data using conditional logistic regression. The results demonstrate how the choice of a function for quantification of exposure can affect the exposure\textendash response analysis and the risk estimates it yields. \textcopyright{} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. \textcopyright{} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We consider the problem of estimating the parameters in the Cox model when the longitudinal covariate is measured infrequently and with measurement error. We assume a repeated measures random effects model for the covariate process. Estimates of the parameters are obtained by maximizing the joint likelihood for the covariate process and the failure time process. This approach uses the available information optimally because we use both the covariate and survival data simultaneously. Parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We argue that such a method is superior to naive methods where one maximizes the partial likelihood of the Cox model using the observed covariate values. It also improves on two-stage methods where, in the first stage, empirical Bayes estimates of the covariate process are computed and then used as time-dependent covariates in a second stage to find the parameters in the Cox model that maximize the partial likelihood.},

We propose a joint modeling approach based on functional data analysis to study the relationship between the baseline longitudinal cocaine-use pattern and the interval censored time to first relapse. For the baseline cocaine-use pattern, we consider both self-reported cocaine-use amount trajectories and dichotomized use trajectories. Variations within the generalized longitudinal trajectories are modeled through a latent Gaussian process, which is characterized by a few leading functional principal components. The association between the baseline longitudinal trajectories and the time to first relapse is built upon the latent principal component scores. The mean and the eigenfunctions of the latent Gaussian process as well as the hazard function of time to first relapse are modeled nonparametrically using penalized splines, and the parameters in the joint model are estimated by a Monte Carlo EM algorithm based on Metropolis\textendash Hastings steps. An Akaike information criterion (AIC) based on effective degrees of freedom is proposed to choose the tuning parameters, and a modified empirical information is proposed to estimate the variance\textendash covariance matrix of the estimators.},

Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of {$<$} or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day.

At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03).
