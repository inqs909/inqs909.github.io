  abstract = {[This article deals with statistical inferences based on the varying-coefficient models proposed by Hastie and Tibshirani. Local polynomial regression techniques are used to estimate coefficient functions, and the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators is established. The standard error formulas for estimated coefficients are derived and are empirically tested. A goodness-of-fit test technique, based on a nonparametric maximum likelihood ratio type of test, is also proposed to detect whether certain coefficient functions in a varying-coefficient model are constant or whether any covariates are statistically significant in the model. The null distribution of the test is estimated by a conditional bootstrap method. Our estimation techniques involve solving hundreds of local likelihood equations. To reduce the computational burden, a one-step Newton-Raphson estimator is proposed and implemented. The resulting one-step procedure is shown to save computational cost on an order of tens with no deterioration in performance, both asymptotically and empirically. Both simulated and real data examples are used to illustrate our proposed methodology.]},

The coefficients are estimated locally based on the partial likelihood in a window around each time point. Multiple time-dependent covariates are incorporated in the local partial likelihood procedure. The procedure is useful as a diagnostic tool and can be used in uncovering time-dependencies or departure from the proportional hazards model. The programming involved in the local partial likelihood estimation is relatively simple and it can be modified with few efforts from the existing programs for the proportional hazards model. The asymptotic properties of the resulting estimator are established and compared with those from the local constant fitting. A consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance is also proposed. The approach is illustrated by a real data set from the study of gastric cancer patients and a simulation study is also presented.},

The new technical challenge is that the nonparametric component is indirectly estimated through its integrated derivative function from a local polynomial fit. An algorithm of fast implementation of our proposed method is presented. Consistent standard error estimates using sandwich-type ideas are also developed, which facilitates inferences for the model. It is shown that the nonparametric component can be estimated as well as if the parametric components were known and the failure times within each subject were independent.

  abstract = {[Estimating equations have found wide popularity recently in parametric problems, yielding consistent estimators with asymptotically valid inferences obtained via the sandwich formula. Motivated by a problem in nutritional epidemiology, we use estimating equations to derive nonparametric estimators of a "parameter" depending on a predictor. The nonparametric component is estimated via local polynomials with loess or kernel weighting; asymptotic theory is derived for the latter. In keeping with the estimating equation paradigm, variances of the nonparametric function estimate are estimated using the sandwich method, in an automatic fashion, without the need (typical in the literature) to derive asymptotic formulas and plug-in an estimate of a density function. The same philosophy is used in estimating the bias of the nonparametric function; that is, an empirical method is used without deriving asymptotic theory on a case-by-case basis. The methods are applied to a series of examples. The application to nutrition is called "nonparametric calibration" after the term used for studies in that field. Other applications include local polynomial regression for generalized linear models, robust local regression, and local transformations in a latent variable model. Extensions to partially parametric models are discussed.]},

This model usually assumes that the covariate has a log-linear effect on the hazard function. In this paper we consider the proportional hazards regression model with a nonparametric risk effect. We discuss estimation of the risk function and its derivatives in two cases: when the baseline hazard function is parametrized and when it is not parametrized. In the case of a parametric baseline hazard function, inference is based on a local version of the likelihood function, while in the case of a nonparametric baseline hazard, we use a local version of the partial likelihood. This results in maximum local likelihood estimators and maximum local partial likelihood estimators, respectively. We establish the asymptotic normality of the estimators.

A viable semiparametric model for covariance matrixes has been proposed that allows one to estimate the variance function nonparametrically and to estimate the correlation function parametrically by aggregating information from irregular and sparse data points within each subject. But the asymptotic properties of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of parameters in the covariance model are largely unknown. We address this problem in the context of more general models for the conditional mean function, including parametric, nonparametric, or semiparametric. We also consider the possibility of rough mean regression function and introduce the difference-based method to reduce biases in the context of varying-coefficient partially linear mean regression models. This provides a more robust estimator of the covariance function under a wider range of situations. Under some technical conditions, consistency and asymptotic normality are obtained for the QMLE of the parameters in the correlation function. Simulation studies and a real data example are used to illustrate the proposed approach.},

When the dimension of independent variables is high, it is difficult to conduct efficient non-parametric analysis straightforwardly from the data. As an important alternative to the additive and other non-parametric models, varying-coefficient models can reduce the modelling bias and avoid the ``curse of dimensionality'' significantly. In addition, the coefficient functions can easily be estimated via a simple local regression. Based on local polynomial techniques, we provide the asymptotic distribution for the maximum of the normalized deviations of the estimated coefficient functions away from the true coefficient functions. Using this result and the pre-asymptotic substitution idea for estimating biases and variances, simultaneous confidence bands for the underlying coefficient functions are constructed. An important question in the varying coefficient models is whether an estimated coefficient function is statistically significantly different from zero or a constant. Based on newly derived asymptotic theory, a formal procedure is proposed for testing whether a particular parametric form fits a given data set. Simulated and real-data examples are used to illustrate our techniques.},

In analyzing such data, regression coefficients are commonly assumed constant over time, which may not properly account for the time-varying effects of some subject characteristics on a sequence of binary outcomes. This paper proposes a Bayesian method for the analysis of binary longitudinal data with time-varying regression coefficients and random effects to account for nonlinear subject-specific effects over time as well as between-subject variation. The proposed method facilitates posterior computation via the method of partial collapse and accommodates spatially inhomogeneous smoothness of nonparametric functions without overfitting via a basis search technique.

We also consider what happens when the predictor is measured with error. Using the SIMEX approach to correct for measurement error, we construct an asymptotic theory for both the pooled and the weighted average estimators.

The aims of this paper are to give an overview on the existing methodological and theoretical developments for varying coefficient models and to discuss their extensions with some new developments. The new developments enable us to use different amount of smoothing for estimating different component functions in the models. They are for a flexible form of varying coefficient models that requires smoothing across different covariates' spaces and are based on the smooth backfitting technique that is admitted as a powerful technique for fitting structural regression models and is also known to free us from the curse of dimensionality.},

  abstract = {The proposed functional varying coefficient model provides a versatile and flexible analysis tool for relating longitudinal responses to longitudinal predictors. Specifically, this approach provides a novel representation of varying coefficient functions through suitable auto and cross-covariances of the underlying stochastic processes, which is particularly advantageous for sparse and irregular designs, as often encountered in longitudinal studies. Existing methodology for varying coefficient models is not adapted to such data. The proposed approach extends the customary varying coefficient models to a more general setting, in which not only current but also recent past values of the predictor time course may have an impact on the current value of the response time course. The influence of past predictor values is modeled by a smooth history index function, while the effects on the response are described by smooth varying coefficient functions. The resulting estimators for varying coefficient and history index functions are shown to be asymptotically consistent for sparse designs. In addition, prediction of unobserved response trajectories from sparse measurements on a predictor trajectory is obtained, along with asymptotic pointwise confidence bands. The proposed methods perform well in simulations, especially when compared with commonly used local polynomial smoothing methods for varying coefficient models, and are illustrated with longitudinal primary biliary liver cirrhosis data. The data application and detailed assumptions and proofs can be found in online Supplemental Material.},

  abstract = {[In the analysis of censored failure time observations, the standard Cox proportional hazards model assumes that the regression coefficients are time invariant. Often, these parameters vary over time, and the temporal covariate effects on the failure time are of great interest. In this article, following previous work of Cai and Sun, we propose a simple estimation procedure for the Cox model with time-varying coefficients based on a kernel-weighted partial likelihood approach. We construct pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals for the regression parameters over a properly chosen time interval via a simple resampling technique. We derive a prediction method for future patients' survival with any specific set of covariates. Building on the estimates for the time-varying coefficients, we also consider the mixed case and present an estimation procedure for time-independent parameters in the model. Furthermore, we show how to use an integrated function of the estimate for a specific regression coefficient to examine the adequacy of proportional hazards assumption for the corresponding covariate graphically and numerically. All of the proposals are illustrated extensively with a well-known study from the Mayo Clinic.]},

Here we propose such an estimator and generalize the work to marginal generalized partially linear models. We investigate asymptotic relative efficiencies of the estimators that ignore the within-cluster correlation structure either in nonparametric curve estimation or throughout. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of these estimators through simulations and illustrate it using a longitudinal CD4 cell count dataset. Both theoretical and numerical results indicate that properly taking into account the within-subject correlation among the responses can substantially improve efficiency.},

It has been shown rather inexplicably that, when standard kernel smoothing methods are used in a natural way, higher efficiency is obtained by assuming independence than by using the true correlation structure. It is shown here that this result is a natural consequence of how standard kernel methods incorporate the within-subject correlation in the asymptotic setting considered, where the cluster sizes are fixed and the cluster number increases. In this paper, an alternative kernel smoothing method is proposed. Unlike the standard methods, the smallest variance of the new estimator is achieved when the true correlation is assumed. Asymptotically, the variance of the proposed method is uniformly smaller than that of the most efficient working independence approach. A small simulation study shows that significant improvement is obtained for finite samples.},

The relationship between the dependent variable and the covariates is assumed to be linear at a specific time point, but the coefficients are allowed to change over time. Two kernel estimators based on componentwise local least squares criteria are proposed to estimate the time varying coefficients. A cross-validation criterion and a bootstrap procedure are used for selecting data-driven bandwidths and constructing confidence intervals, respectively. The theoretical properties of our estimators are developed through their asymptotic mean squared errors and mean integrated squared errors. The finite sample properties of our procedures are investigated through a simulation study. Applications of our procedures are illustrated through an epidemiological example of predicting the effects of cigarette smoking, pre-HIV infection CD4 cell percentage and age at HIV infection on the depletion of CD4 cell percentage among HIV infected persons.},

First, we show that the naive empirical likelihood ratio is asymptotically standard chi-squared when undersmoothing is employed. The ratio is self-scale invariant and the plug-in estimate of the limiting variance is not needed. Second, to enhance the performance of the ratio, mean-corrected and residual-adjusted empirical likelihood ratios are recommended. The merit of these two bias corrections is that without undersmoothing, both also have standard chi-squared limits. Third, a maximum empirical likelihood estimator (MELE) of the time-varying coefficient is defined, the asymptotic equivalence to the weighted least-squares estimator (WLSE) is provided, and the asymptotic normality is shown. By the empirical likelihood ratios and the normal approximation of the MELE/WLSE, the confidence regions of the time-varying coefficients are constructed. Fourth, when some components are of particular interest, we suggest using mean-corrected and residual-adjusted partial empirical likelihood ratios to construct the confidence regions/intervals. In addition, we also consider the construction of the simultaneous and bootstrap confidence bands. A simulation study is undertaken to compare the empirical likelihood, the normal approximation, and the bootstrap methods in terms of coverage accuracies and average areas/widths of confidence regions/bands. An example in epidemiology is used for illustration.},

  abstract = {Most of the literature on clustered data models emphasizes two-level clustering, and within-cluster correlation. While multi-level clustered data models can arise in practice, analysis of multi-level clustered data models poses additional difficulties owing to the existence of error correlations both within and across the clusters. It is perhaps for this reason that existing approaches to multi-level clustered data models have been mostly parametric. The purpose of this paper is to develop a varying-coefficient nonparametric approach to the analysis of three-level clustered data models. Because the nonparametric functions are restricted only to some of the variables, this approach has the appeal of avoiding many of the curse of dimensionality problems commonly associated with other nonparametric methods. By applying an undersmoothing technique, taking into account the correlations within and across clusters, we develop an efficient two-stage local polynomial estimation procedure for the unknown coefficient functions. The large and finite sample properties of the resultant estimators are examined; in particular, we show that the resultant estimators are asymptotically normal, and exhibit considerably smaller asymptotic variability than the traditional local polynomial estimators that neglect the correlations within and among clusters. An application example is presented based on a data set extracted from the World Bank's STARS database.},
