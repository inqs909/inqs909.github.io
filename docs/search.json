    "text": "This is the first post of my “Rcpp” collection detailing my journey with Rcpp. The “Rcpp” collection contains information about the struggles I faced while implementing Rcpp. Even though my first venture to Rcpp happened in the Summer of 2020, I realized I am learning new things every day. I thought it would be wised to write a blog of everything I have and will learn with Rcpp. I hope this collection will guide other students who have never used c++ before.\nAs I am developing my model for my PhD, a major limiting factor is that my model takes a really long time to compute the results I need. Due to the complexity of the model, I need to approximate different components using iterative algorithms. This in turn increases the computation time to obtain results. You can only imagine my frustration when I first coded my model in R and it took more than a week to obtain results!\nTherefore, I decided to focus on speeding up my code. I spent time reading Wickham’s Advanced R Book to speed up my code. There I learned how about vectorizing code, utilizing built-in optimized functions, and common practices for speed gains. All this work has made me a better R programmer. Unfortunately, when I reran my model, the speed gains was not enough to call my efforts a success.\n\nDue to the lack of improvements, and knowing I will need expand my model for larger data sets, I set on a quest to improve my model. I attacked this problem on two fronts: looking for mathematical methods to reduce my computation needs and implementing different computing techniques. While both components dramatically improved my computational time, implementing c++ via Rcpp was the biggest game changer for my model.\nAfter I implemented everything I can from Wickham’s Book. I began reading more about about c++ from the book’s c++ chapter. I will be honest, I didn’t know what I was doing. This was my first time learning how to use c++. Nevertheless, I was determined to learn more about the c++ due to the potential speed gains. During the summer of 2020, I spent all my time learning about c++ and Rcpp. By the end of my summer, a model that took 3.5 days to converge was now taking approximately 6 hours!\n\nWith this triumph, I have been able to test and diagnose any faults with my model. I can honestly say that implementing Rcpp has drastically improved my PhD experience. I no longer have the feeling of being anxious for days wondering if my model works or not. I feel more productive! With this confidence, I feel prepared to tackle new problems with my research."

    "text": "Using RcppArmadillo\nI like to keep my functions in separate scripts and source them from my main analysis script. Naturally, I have all my cpp function in a separate file. The first thing you will need to do is create a cpp file: file_name.cpp. The first lines in my files are given below5:\n#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;\n#include &lt;Rcpp.h&gt;\n\nusing namespace Rcpp;\nusing namespace arma;\n\n// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]\nThe first couple of lines indicates which header or standard files to be included for compilation. I like to think of them as the library() function in R. The next couple lines indicate the names for different libraries. Different libraries may have functions with the same. Namespace allows you to use functions with the same name but from different libraries. Similar with R’s :: operator. The last line is used by the sourcecpp() function in R. It helps with library dependency.\nNow we can create functions to be utilized in R. The code below calculates the mean in cpp:\n// [[Rcpp::export]]\n\ndouble mean_cpp(arma::vec x){\n  int n = x.size();\n  double x_sum = sum(x);\n  double x_mean = x_sum / n; \n  return x_mean; \n}\nThe first line tells R to make the following function accessible to the user6. The remaining lines are the function itself. Creating a function in cpp is similar to R7. The main difference is that you need to specify the data types. Combining the two chunks together, your cpp file should look similar to the chunk below:\n#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;\n#include &lt;Rcpp.h&gt;\n\nusing namespace Rcpp;\nusing namespace arma;\n\n// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]\n\n// [[Rcpp::export]]\n\ndouble mean_cpp(arma::vec x){\n  int n = x.size();\n  double x_sum = sum(x);\n  double x_mean = x_sum / n; \n  return x_mean; \n}\nIn R, you will need to load the following packages8:\n\nlibrary(Rcpp)\nlibrary(RcppArmadillo)\n\nThe next step is to compile your cpp file. You can do this with the sourceCpp() function:\n\nRcpp::sourceCpp(\"example_cpp.cpp\")\n\nThis will compile your functions and make them executable in R. You can now use your function like any other R function.\n\n## Generating Data\nY &lt;- rnorm(1000)\n\n## Using mean_cpp\nmean_cpp(Y)\n\n[1] -0.007075678\n\n## Using Built-in mean functions\nmean(Y)\n\n[1] -0.007075678\n\n\nTo see the speed gains, we can use the mark() function from the bench package.\n\nbench::mark(\n  mean(Y),\n  mean_cpp(Y)\n)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  expression       min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`\n  &lt;bch:expr&gt;  &lt;bch:tm&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;bch:byt&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 mean(Y)       3.34µs   3.81µs   246497.        0B        0\n2 mean_cpp(Y)   1.86µs   2.81µs   364831.    7.67KB        0\n\n\nYou can see that the cpp function is much faster than the R built-in function."

    "text": "Speed Gains Explanation\nYou may be asking why is R much slower than cpp. From what I can gather, R is an interpreted language while cpp is a compiled language. While I don’t really know what the difference is, it makes cpp much faster.\nI like to think there is a difference of requirements. You need to be more careful with cpp because it does not convert inputs to the correct data type. R will do it automatically. Therefore, R takes more time to ensure everything is correct before computing a function. Cpp requires more thinking from the user, but will reward them with speed gains. I am sure there is way more to this simple explanation, but the end result is that cpp is much faster than R."

For example, I want to incorporate the GNU Scientific Library. I learned there is an R package exists for the library, RcppGSL! This gives me hope that I can use it for my research. However, I want to use the Armadillo library alongside with GSL. This has a potential to bring new problems with data type incompatibilities. I have ideas for potential solutions, but I will need to test them out.\nI also want to learn more about the capabilities of Rcpp. Specifically, what other functions does it contain. I learned that Rcpp has functions for distribution functions. This can be useful for expanding my research."

    "text": "Development\nFor the remainder of the Fall quarter, I began talking to other graduate students about creating a mentoring program within the department. I pitched them that they will mentor an undergraduate student for a statistical project. Many students seemed on board to participate in the program. Afterwards, I started asking Teaching Faculty to support the program. By the end of the quarter, I had an idea of the support I will get from the department.\nTowards the end of the year, almost everyone had a rough winter due to the pandemic. Fatigued had set in to many students, and they needed time to rest. I myself struggled through the winter. It was challenging to rest during my break due to competing pressures. While I did manage to get through the winter, I did not want to add any extra pressure to the remaining graduate students that expressed interest in mentoring in the program. I decided to wait until half way through the quarter to begin asking graduate students for their commitment to the program. Fortunately, everyone was excited to be a mentor in the program.\nAt the same time, I was worried about having graduate students coming up with a project. I was afraid that students could not come up with an idea that was feasible for an undergraduate student to complete, so I decided to come up with a project that anyone can easily do. Thus the ucrstats package was born. The idea was for a mentor teach an undergrad about a topic, then the mentee can create a learnr tutorial to teach other students. The only thing the mentor needed to do was gather materials and R code for the student to learn about the topic. The tutorials can easily be created using an RMarkdown file. At the end, the mentee will have a product that they can show off and put on their CV. It was a different type of project that focused on programming than the traditional form of research. Fortunately, all other graduate students had project ideas; however, this can be a good back up for those who do not have a project idea. Additionally, the package can be utilized from other graduate students in different departments who want to learn more about statistics."

We ranked each student based on their interests, the classes they have completed, and how well they met the admission criteria. From their, we selected students based on their rankings.\nLooking back at the application process, there are couple of things I wish we could have done a bit differently. First, I think we should ask for CVs or resumes. This way we can better learn about the student. Second, the application process should begin at least a month before the start of the quarter. We had to operate with some tight deadlines and I did not enjoy the pressure. Other than that I will need to consult with the current cohort for more recommendations."

The remainder of the quarter went smoothly. There were a few bumps in the roads here and there, but most of it was providing guidance to the mentors. At the end of the quarter, we held a symposium where all groups presented their work.\nStarting a program is tough! I worried about so many things. Mostly making sure both the mentors and mentees were progressing with their projects and gaining something the other time. However, I just needed to have faith that everything will go well. Fortunately, the pilot was a success! I was so impressed by everyone’s presentation, and I think we showed the department how capable both the graduate and undergraduate students are in completing a project.

Lastly, this will help the environmental part of my life by reducing my environmental impact and using less plastic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\nI will travel to a new city in Southern CA each month and buy their local newspaper.\n\n\nOne of my main goals is to travel more globally and locally. I especially want to get to know small communities located in Southern California. For that reason, I want to make an effort to explore more of Southern CA. This goal has the potential to affect four aspects of my life: mental, social, spiritual, and physical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\nI will go swimming two times a week for 30 minutes.\n\n\nWhen I was planning to move to Camarillo, I wanted to start something new for my physical health. Therefore, I decided to start swimming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\nI will go to the gym three times a week for 1 hour.\n\n\nSimilar to swimming, I want to develop new habits and exercise more. Developing this habit and going to the gym more will help my physical health."

    "text": "Plan\n\nGoal 1Goal 2Goal 3Goal 4Goal 5\n\n\nSince I am struggling to keep my research productivity up, I will try new strategies. To get more research done, I plan to work on research as the very first thing I do when I get into my office. If I complete this task at the beginning of my day, I will get it out of the way and focus on things that are easier for me. The idea is to do the things I struggle with at the very beginning of my day.\nAdditionally, I plan to use the Forest App to maintain my focus. I will do a 20 minute session of writing1 and then do a 10 minute break. I will repeat this process until I complete an hour of writing.\n\n\nRight now, I am working on learning how to make a chai latte at home. So far, I have learned how to make oat milk how I like it. Next, I want to make chai concentrate using raw ingredients. I have bought many of the tools and feel ready to start experimenting with making the concentrate.\nOther types of teas that I want to learn are hibiscus and Thai.\n\n\nI first plan to visit Ojai in February. Depending on the weather, I want to visit Twentynine Palms for the super bloom; otherwise, I will visit Carpinteria. Lastly, I want to visit Idyllwild. I want to visit a special event/festival for each location if possible.\n\n\nBecause I set this goal for two 30 minute sessions, I believe I can complete this task. It is easier to spend a quick 30 minute session than a full hour.\n\n\nSimilar to my research goals, I plan to go to the gym in the morning and get them done early so I can focus on other things I am interested in. I plan to go to the gym early every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This task will be before my writing sessions."

Overall, I want to create consistency with these goals. Any positive gain will be a win. At the end of the semester, I plan to reflect on the process and see what worked and what did not."

As I was reading about topics related to Rcpp. I noticed how difficult it was to implement Rcpp for my needs. At the same moment, it dawned on me that I am reading from individuals that at some point in time were struggling with the same issues. This inspired me to create a blog of my own with the same intentions to help other individuals. My hope is to demonstrate how I overcame the challenges I faced to others that are facing similar issues.\nI don’t know how this blog will go. It’s going to be a learning experience. I don’t even know how many blog posts I will write in a year. I don’t even know what topics I will write about. However, I hope overtime, I can create a blog that may help people."
