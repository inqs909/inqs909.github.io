## Conducting Inference

## Are we seeing something or is it just noise???

Are we seeing something different from what was expected? Or is it due to random chance?

## Hypothesis Testing

::: incremental
1.  Set Up the Null and Alternative Hypothesis
2.  Construct a test statistic based on the null hypothesis
3.  Construct a distribution of the test statistic based on probability theory
4.  Compute the probability of observing the test statistic
5.  Make a decision based on the probability
:::

## What if we cannot construct the distribution?!?!

We bring out the **Monte Carlo** methods!
:::
:::
:::

## Monte Carlo Methods

-   Monte Carlo Methods are used to construct a distribution function of an obscure test statistic.
-   We simulate a large number of data sets based on the null hypothesis.
-   We construct a test statistic for each fake data set and the real one.
-   We count how many data sets produce a test statistic that is more extreme than the real test statistic.
-   $p=\#\ of\ extreme\ data\ sets\ /\ all\ data\ sets$

## Overview Research

::: incremental
1.  Ask a question about a population
2.  Collect data from a sample
3.  Construct and test a hypothesis
4.  Draw conclusion about the population
5.  Refine your question and methodology

### Survival

## Modelling them Jointly

## Data

With $n$ participants, each $i^{th}$ participant has:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Longitudinal Data

-   $n_i$ repeated measurements

-   $t_{i}=(t_{i1}, t_{i2}, \cdots, t_{in_i})^\mathrm T$

-   $Y_i=(Y_{i1}, Y_{i2}, \cdots, Y_{in_i})^\mathrm T$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Survival Data

-   $T_i$: Observed time

-   $\delta_i$: Censoring status
:::
:::

## Longitudinal Submodels {.smaller}

Our longitudinal outcome y can be represented in 2 components: a linear model and an error term. The linear $$\Large{Y_{ij} = m_i (t_{ij}) + \epsilon_i(t_{ij}),}$$

where

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   $m_i(t_{ij})=\boldsymbol{X}_{ij}^\mathrm T\boldsymbol \beta + \boldsymbol Z_{ij}^\mathrm Tb_i$

-   $\boldsymbol X_{ij}$: design matrix

-   $\boldsymbol \beta=(\beta_1,\cdots,\beta_p)^\mathrm T$: regression coefficients

-   $b_i \sim N_q(\boldsymbol 0, \boldsymbol G)$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   $\epsilon_i(t_{ij})$: error term at time $t_{ij}$

-   $\epsilon_i(t_{ij}) \sim N(0, \sigma²)$
:::
:::

## Survival Submodels {.smaller}

$$\large{\lambda_i\{t|M_i(t),X_i\}=\lim_{\Delta\rightarrow 0}\frac{ P\{t\leq T_i <t+\Delta|T_i\geq t, M_i(t),\boldsymbol X_{i1}\}}{\Delta}}$$ $$\large{\lambda_i\{t|M_i(t),\boldsymbol X_{i1}\}=\lambda_0(t)\exp\{\boldsymbol X_{i1}^\mathrm T\boldsymbol \gamma+\alpha m_i(t)\}}$$

where

-   $\lambda_0(t)$: baseline hazard function
-   $\boldsymbol X_{i1}$: design matrix at first time point
-   $\boldsymbol \gamma$: regression coefficients
-   $\alpha$: association coefficient
-   $M_i(t)$: history of the longitudinal outcome

## Construction of the Joint Model

$$P(T_i, \delta_i, \boldsymbol Y_i; \boldsymbol \theta)$$

$$
P(T_i, \delta_i, \boldsymbol Y_i; \boldsymbol \theta) \neq P(T_i, \delta_i; \boldsymbol \theta) P( \boldsymbol Y_i; \boldsymbol \theta)

## Construction of Joint Model

$$\begin{eqnarray}
P(T_i, \delta_i, \boldsymbol Y_i; \boldsymbol \theta) &=& \int  P(T_{i},\delta_{i}|b_{i};\boldsymbol \theta)P(\boldsymbol Y_{i}|b_{i};\boldsymbol \theta)P(b_{i};\boldsymbol \theta) db_i\\
& = & \int  P(T_{i},\delta_{i}|b_{i};\boldsymbol \theta) \prod^{n_i}_j P(\boldsymbol Y_{ij}|b_{i};\boldsymbol \theta)P(b_{i};\boldsymbol \theta) db_i
\end{eqnarray}$$

## Estimation of parameters

::: fragment
In order to estimate the paramters ($\theta$), we must predict the random effects.
:::

::: fragment
We must take care of the integral!
:::

::: fragment
We either treat the random effects as parameters!
:::

::: fragment
OR, we treat the random effects as missing!
:::

## Missing!?

## Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### E-Step

Numerical techniques are used to target the random effects in the joint density function

-   Gaussian Quadrature

-   Laplace Approximation

### M-Step

## Estimation of Margin of Error

The standard errors of the parameters can be computed either as:

-   Variance of the estimator, following probability model

-   Using large sample theory of MLE, use the negative inverse Hessian matrix

## Estimation of Margin of Error

The standard errors of the parameters can be computed either as:

-   Variance of the estimator, following probability model

-   Using large sample theory of MLE, use the negative inverse Hessian matrix

**The Standard Errors are Biased due to misspecification of the random effects and baseline hazard function.**

## Bootstrapping {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Bootstrapping can nonparametrically (or parameterically) compute the unbiased standard errors.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Bootstrapping is conducted by sampling from the data set with replacement.

-   Then a test statistic is constructed for each boot sample.

-   The process is repeated many times until a distribution is constructed.

-   Standard Errors (or Confidence Intervals) are obtained from the distribution.

-   For joint models, the individual is sampled.

## Train of Thoughts

::: fragment
There are two train of thoughts on how to interpret estimates and probability.
:::

::: fragment
One approach is the Frequentist approach.
:::

::: fragment
The other approach is the Bayesian approach.
:::

::: fragment
Both sides hate each other.
:::

## Frequentists

## Frequentists

A frequentist, in the context of statistics, is an individual who adheres to the frequentist interpretation of probability and statistical inference.

::: fragment
Meaning probability is obtained by the repetition of multiple experiments.

## Bayesians

## Bayesians

A Bayesians, in the context of statistics, is an individual who adheres to the Bayesian interpretation of probability and statistical inference.
