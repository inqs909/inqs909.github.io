## What does a Statistician say?

It is the study of variation and randomness!

::: fragment
Using mathematics, we model randomness to characterizes commonality and variation!
:::

::: fragment
Using science, we systematically refine models to better fit randomness in data!
:::

::: fragment
Using art, when it all eventually fails!

## What is the formal definition of Statistics?

Statistics is both the development of mathematical models to be used in real-world data and the analysis of data using existing models.

-   Model observations that follow a new data generating process

-   Understand its properties

-   Develop new probability distributions

-   Known as Probability Theory

-   Researcher is a Probabilist

## Data Analysis

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Model data with a known probability model

-   Account for sources of variation and bias

## Goal: Inference

Use our sample data to understand the larger population.

::: fragment
The data will tell us how the population generally behaves.
:::

::: fragment
The data will guide us in the differences in the unit.
:::

::: fragment
Data will tell us if there is a signal or just noise.
