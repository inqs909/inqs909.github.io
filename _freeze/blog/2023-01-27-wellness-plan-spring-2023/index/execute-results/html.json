Below is a list of areas that are important to me:\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Mental\n\n-   Emotional\n\n-   Social\n\n-   Spiritual\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Physical\n\n-   Environmental\n\n-   Financial\n\n-   Career\n:::\n:::::\n\nWhile there are many other aspects of my life that I would like to improve on, this is a good starting point for this semester.\n\n## Goals\n\nLooking at the areas that I want to focus on, I want to create realistic goals. Additionally, each goal can satisfy multiple aspects of my life. I will use SMART goals to ensure [SMART](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf) goals to make sure I create achievable goals. The period for all the goals is the Spring semester.\n\n:::::::: panel-tabset\n## Goal 1\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Goal\n\nI will spend at least 1 hour every day, Monday through Friday, working on research related to my dissertation.\n:::\n\nI want to increase my research productivity for my own career goals. Additionally, working on this will help me through my tenure process.\n\n## Goal 2\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Goal\n\nI will learn how to create a new tea-related beverage at home each month.\n:::\n\nThis goal has the potential to serve three aspects of my life: Physical, Environmental, and Financial. Learning how to create new tea drinks will allow me to save money instead of buying them from different coffee shops. Additionally, I will know what ingredients are used in the drinks. Therefore, I will be able to improve the physical aspect of my life. Lastly, this will help the environmental part of my life by reducing my environmental impact and using less plastic.\n\n## Goal 3\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Goal\n\nI will travel to a new city in Southern CA each month and buy their local newspaper.\n:::\n\nOne of my main goals is to travel more globally and locally. I especially want to get to know small communities located in Southern California. For that reason, I want to make an effort to explore more of Southern CA. This goal has the potential to affect four aspects of my life: mental, social, spiritual, and physical.\n\n## Goal 4\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Goal\n\nI will go swimming two times a week for 30 minutes.\n:::\n\nWhen I was planning to move to Camarillo, I wanted to start something new for my physical health. Therefore, I decided to start swimming.\n\n## Goal 5\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Goal\n\nI will go to the gym three times a week for 1 hour.\n:::\n\nSimilar to swimming, I want to develop new habits and exercise more. Developing this habit and going to the gym more will help my physical health.\n::::::::\n\n## Plan\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Goal 1\n\nSince I am struggling to keep my research productivity up, I will try new strategies. To get more research done, I plan to work on research as the very first thing I do when I get into my office. If I complete this task at the beginning of my day, I will get it out of the way and focus on things that are easier for me. The idea is to do the things I struggle with at the very beginning of my day.\n\nAdditionally, I plan to use the [Forest App](https://www.forestapp.cc/) to maintain my focus. I will do a 20 minute session of writing[^1] and then do a 10 minute break. I will repeat this process until I complete an hour of writing.\n\n## Goal 2\n\nRight now, I am working on learning how to make a chai latte at home. So far, I have learned how to make oat milk how I like it. Next, I want to make chai concentrate using raw ingredients. I have bought many of the tools and feel ready to start experimenting with making the concentrate.\n\nOther types of teas that I want to learn are hibiscus and Thai.\n\n## Goal 3\n\nI first plan to visit Ojai in February. Depending on the weather, I want to visit Twentynine Palms for the [super bloom](https://sandiegoexplorer.com/california-wildflowers-california-superbloom/); otherwise, I will visit Carpinteria. Lastly, I want to visit Idyllwild. I want to visit a special event/festival for each location if possible.\n\n## Goal 4\n\nBecause I set this goal for two 30 minute sessions, I believe I can complete this task. It is easier to spend a quick 30 minute session than a full hour.\n\n## Goal 5\n\nSimilar to my research goals, I plan to go to the gym in the morning and get them done early so I can focus on other things I am interested in. I plan to go to the gym early every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This task will be before my writing sessions.\n:::\n\n[^1]: writing means any task related to research\n\n## Accountability\n\nThere are two ways that I will try told hold myself accountable. First, I will share my wellness plan with friends and family members. Second, I will create an incentive plan for each goal I complete. I will reassess my goals before spring break (3/17/23) and adjust accordingly. Overall, I want to create consistency with these goals. Any positive gain will be a win. At the end of the semester, I plan to reflect on the process and see what worked and what did not.",
